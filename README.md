Note 28/04/24 9:37pm CET - trying to post all source code through github.dev, its working but its been uploading for like an hour now and we're at 3000 out of 30000 files, will leave running overnight (im really wondering why ionic has so many files its actually insane but I want to include everything I can)

<sub><sup>Note: I have not yet been tested on deployment, this app has been designed for a mobile device (specifically iOS) and has not been deployed as an app through capacitor nor a viewable github page</sup></sub>
