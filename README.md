Note 28/04/24 9:37pm CET - trying to post all source code through github.dev, its working but its been uploading for like an hour now and we're at 3,000 out of 30,000 files, will leave running overnight (im really wondering why ionic has so many files its actually insane but I want to include everything I can also please don't mind all of the README updates I keep thinking of things to change)
Note 29/04/24 5:45am CET - im not really understanding why its uploading at like 4kb/s considering my internet speed is quite high, we're at like 11,000 files right now so i guess I'll leave it running for longer.

<sub><sup>Note: I have not yet been tested on deployment, this app has been designed for a mobile device (specifically iOS) and has not been deployed as an app through capacitor nor a viewable github page</sup></sub>
